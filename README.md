# lifeofguenter.php7-cli

This role will install PHP7.1 (cli) from custom built deb packages.

_Please note: this is simply meant as a interim to have PHP7.1 on the flavours:
debian jessie/stretch + ubuntu trusty/xenial. The packages are compiled from
source with no additional patches, so production ready, but please keep updated
and scrutinise it before using._

_Deb-packages are pre-generated with `checkinstall` just to avoid compiling from
scratch during each ansible run._
